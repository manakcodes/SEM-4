ANSWER : 1

1. Database

A Database is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. It stores data in such a way that it is efficient for retrieval, insertion, deletion, and updating.

Example:
A school database may store data about students, teachers, classes, and results.

2. DBMS (Database Management System)

A DBMS is software that interacts with users, applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data. It provides tools for defining, constructing, manipulating, and sharing databases among various users and applications.

Key Functions of DBMS:
	•	Data storage, retrieval, and manipulation
	•	Data security and integrity
	•	Backup and recovery
	•	Multi-user access and concurrency control

Examples of DBMS:
MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MongoDB.

3. Metadata

Metadata is “data about data”. It provides information about the structure, format, and organization of data stored in a database.

Example:
If a database table stores student information, then:
	•	Table name: Students
	•	Column names: ID, Name, Age, Class
	•	Data types: INT, VARCHAR, INT, VARCHAR
These details are metadata.

ANSWER 6 : 

Problems with File System Data Management

Before the introduction of Database Management Systems (DBMS), data was managed using file systems. However, this approach had several limitations and problems:

1. Data Redundancy
	•	Same data is stored in multiple files, leading to duplication.
	•	Increases storage cost and risks of inconsistency.

2. Data Inconsistency
	•	When the same data appears in different files but is not updated uniformly, it leads to inconsistent data.
	•	For example, a customer’s address may be updated in one file but not in another.

3. Lack of Data Integrity
	•	No constraints or rules enforce data accuracy.
	•	Data can be entered in wrong formats or with invalid values, leading to errors.

4. Limited Data Sharing
	•	Data is often isolated in separate files, making it hard for multiple users or applications to access or combine data effectively.

5. Difficulty in Accessing Data
	•	Complex application programs must be written to retrieve data.
	•	No standard querying language like SQL.

These issues led to the development of Database Management Systems (DBMS), which solve most of these problems by centralizing data storage and providing better control.

ANSWER 9 : 

SQL Commands: DML and DDL

SQL (Structured Query Language) includes different types of commands used to interact with a database. Two important categories are:

✅ 1. DDL – Data Definition Language

DDL commands are used to define and manage database structure or schema. These commands deal with the creation, alteration, and deletion of tables and other database objects.

Common DDL Commands:

CREATE
Creates a new table, view, index, or database object. Example: CREATE TABLE Students (ID INT, Name VARCHAR(50));

ALTER
Modifies an existing database object (like adding or deleting columns). Example: ALTER TABLE Students ADD Age INT;

DROP
Deletes a table or database object permanently. Example: DROP TABLE Students;

TRUNCATE
Removes all rows from a table but does not delete the table itself. Example: TRUNCATE TABLE Students;

RENAME
Renames a table or column. Example: RENAME TABLE Students TO Learners;


DML – Data Manipulation Language

DML commands are used to manipulate or process data stored in existing tables. These commands are responsible for inserting, updating, deleting, and querying data.

Common DML Commands:

SELECT
Retrieves data from one or more tables. Example: SELECT * FROM Students;

INSERT
Adds new records into a table. Example: INSERT INTO Students (ID, Name) VALUES (1, 'Alex');

UPDATE
Modifies existing data in a table. Example: UPDATE Students SET Name = 'Alice' WHERE ID = 1;

DELETE
Removes one or more records from a table. Example: DELETE FROM Students WHERE ID = 1;

Key Differences Between DDL and DML

Affects | Schema/structure | Data/records
Auto-commit? | Yes (changes are permanent) | No (can be rolled back)
Used for | Creating/modifying tables | Managing data inside tables

ANSWER 10 : 

SQL Logical Operators

SQL logical operators are used to filter records based on specific conditions. They are typically used in conjunction with the WHERE clause to combine multiple conditions in SQL queries. Logical operators help refine and control the query results.

⸻

✅ Common SQL Logical Operators

1. AND Operator
	•	Description: The AND operator is used to combine multiple conditions in a WHERE clause. It returns true only if all conditions are true.
	•	Syntax: 
    SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition1 AND condition2;
    •	Example:
    SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Age > 30 AND Salary > 50000;

    This will return records where the Age is greater than 30 and the Salary is greater than 50,000.

    2. OR Operator
	•	Description: The OR operator is used to combine multiple conditions in a WHERE clause. It returns true if at least one condition is true.
	•	Syntax:
    SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition1 OR condition2;
    •	Example:
    SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Age > 30 OR Salary > 50000;
    This will return records where the Age is greater than 30 or the Salary is greater than 50,000.

    3. NOT Operator
	•	Description: The NOT operator is used to negate a condition. It returns true if the condition is false.
	•	Syntax:
    SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE NOT condition;
    •	Example:
    SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE NOT (Age > 30);
    This will return records where the Age is not greater than 30.

    4. BETWEEN Operator
	•	Description: The BETWEEN operator is used to filter the result set within a range of values. It is inclusive of the boundary values.
	•	Syntax:
    SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
    •	Example:
    SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Salary BETWEEN 40000 AND 70000;
    This will return records where the Salary is between 40,000 and 70,000 (inclusive).

    5. IN Operator
	•	Description: The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause. It returns true if the value matches any value in the specified list.
	•	Syntax:
    SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);
    •	Example:
    SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Department IN ('HR', 'Finance', 'IT');
    This will return records where the Department is either HR, Finance, or IT.

    ✅ Combining Logical Operators
	•	AND, OR, and NOT can be combined to form complex conditions in queries.
	•	Parentheses () are used to control the order of operations.
    Example:
    SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE (Age > 30 AND Salary > 50000) OR Department = 'IT';
    This will return records where either:
	•	Age is greater than 30 and Salary is greater than 50,000, or
	•	Department is ‘IT’.

ANSWER 11 : 

SQL Special Operators

SQL special operators are used to perform operations that go beyond the regular comparison and logical operations. These operators help handle tasks like pattern matching, set operations, and checking for null values, among others. Below are some important special operators in SQL:

✅ 1. EXISTS Operator
	•	Description: The EXISTS operator is used to check whether a subquery returns any records. It returns true if the subquery returns one or more rows.
	•	Syntax:
    SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE EXISTS (subquery);
    •	Example:
    SELECT Name FROM Employees WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM Departments WHERE Employees.DeptID = Departments.DeptID);

    This query will return the Name of employees who belong to an existing department (checked by the subquery).

✅ 2. ANY Operator
	•	Description: The ANY operator is used with a subquery to compare a value to any value in a list or result set. It can be used with operators like =, >, <, >=, <=, and <>.
	•	Syntax:
    SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE column_name operator ANY (subquery);
    •	Example:
    SELECT Name FROM Employees WHERE Salary > ANY (SELECT Salary FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'HR');
    This will return the Name of employees whose salary is greater than any salary in the HR department.

✅ 3. ALL Operator
	•	Description: The ALL operator is used to compare a value to all values in a result set or list. It can be used with comparison operators like =, >, <, >=, <=, and <>.
	•	Syntax:
    SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE column_name operator ALL (subquery);
    •	Example:
    SELECT Name FROM Employees WHERE Salary > ALL (SELECT Salary FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'IT');
    This will return the Name of employees whose salary is greater than all salaries in the IT department.

✅ 4. IN Operator
	•	Description: The IN operator allows you to check if a value matches any value in a list of values or a subquery.
	•	Syntax:
    SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);
    •	Example:
    SELECT Name FROM Employees WHERE Department IN ('HR', 'IT', 'Finance');
    This will return the Name of employees who belong to the HR, IT, or Finance department.

✅ 5. BETWEEN Operator
	•	Description: The BETWEEN operator is used to filter the result set within a range of values (inclusive).
	•	Syntax:
    SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
    •	Example:
    SELECT Name FROM Employees WHERE Salary BETWEEN 40000 AND 70000;
    This will return employees whose Salary is between 40,000 and 70,000 (inclusive).

✅ 6. LIKE Operator
	•	Description: The LIKE operator is used to search for a specified pattern in a column.
	•	Syntax:
    SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE column_name LIKE pattern;
    •	Example:
    SELECT Name FROM Employees WHERE Name LIKE 'A%';
    This will return employees whose Name starts with the letter A.

✅ 7. COALESCE Operator
	•	Description: The COALESCE operator returns the first non-NULL expression from the list of arguments.
	•	Syntax:
    SELECT COALESCE(expression1, expression2, ...);
    •	Example:
    SELECT COALESCE(Address, 'Not Provided') FROM Employees;
    This will return the Address of employees, but if it is NULL, it will return ‘Not Provided’.

ANSWER 12 : 

The Foreign Key Constraint in SQL is used to establish and enforce a link between the columns in two tables. It ensures that the value in the foreign key column must match a value in the primary key column of another table, or be NULL. This constraint ensures referential integrity, which means that relationships between tables are maintained correctly.

Use of Foreign Key Constraint
	•	A Foreign Key is a column (or a set of columns) in one table that refers to the Primary Key in another table.
	•	It ensures that data is consistent across related tables.
	•	It prevents actions that would leave orphan records (records in the foreign key table that have no corresponding record in the referenced table).
	•	It restricts updates and deletes in the referenced table if there are dependent records in the foreign key table.


Syntax of Foreign Key Constraint : 

CREATE TABLE child_table (
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    ...
    CONSTRAINT fk_constraint_name FOREIGN KEY (column_name) REFERENCES parent_table (parent_column_name)
);

Example of Foreign Key Constraint

Consider two tables:
	•	Orders (stores order details)
	•	Customers (stores customer information)

Customers Table:

CREATE TABLE Customers (
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Email VARCHAR(100)
);

Orders Table:

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    OrderDate DATE,
    CustomerID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID)
);


Explanation:
	•	In the Orders table, the CustomerID column is a foreign key that refers to the CustomerID column in the Customers table.
	•	This means each order must belong to a customer. The foreign key ensures that:
	1.	Only valid CustomerID values (those that exist in the Customers table) can be inserted into the Orders table.
	2.	Deleting a customer will not delete the orders unless you use the ON DELETE CASCADE option. This option can automatically delete the orders associated with a customer when that customer is deleted.


Benefits of Foreign Key Constraints:
	•	Referential Integrity: Ensures that the database maintains valid relationships between tables.
	•	Prevents Orphan Records: Prevents records from being added to the foreign key table if there is no matching primary key in the referenced table.
	•	Data Consistency: Ensures the consistency of data when a record is updated or deleted in the referenced table.
